# All About Web Development

(draft version - revisit for gramatical errors)
I'm starting on front end from the very basic and transitioning to the advanced web development. This will also include some small and big projects on React JS. I'll be updating my learnings and even the stack overflow help that I took.

Thinking out loud (categories)

1. Basics [HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS, React JS, Express JS]
2. Data Structures in JS [Algorithm questions in JS]
3. Stack overflow helps
4. Utilities I loved creating
5. Common components I loved creating
6. Projects
7. Interview questions
8. Unit Test Frameworks
